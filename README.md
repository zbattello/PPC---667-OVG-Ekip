## The	Energy	Market 

### 1. The project
The goal of this programming projetc is to design ans implement a multi-process and multithread simulation in Python. The program simulates an energy market where energy-producing and consuming homes, weather conditions and random events contribute to the evolution of energy price overtime :
> Homes can give away their surplus energy, sell it to the market or buy it from the same place. The prices can go up because of temperature changes or when the average consumption exceeds that of production. Other events, such as laws, diplomatic tension etc. can impact energy prices.
